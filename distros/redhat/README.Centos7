What's New
==========

1. The Apache ScriptAlias has been changed from "/cgi-bin/zm/zms" to 
   "/cgi-bin-zm/zms". This has been to done to avoid this bug:
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=973067

   IMPORTANT: ZoneMinder will not update this value during an upgrade. You must
   manually update ZM_PATH_ZMS yourself under Options. This does not affect
   new installs.

2. During an rpm package upgrade, zmupdate.pl will now auto-update the database
   and the zonemidner service will restart automatically.

3. The ZoneMinder config file, zm.conf, has been moved under /etc/zm.

4. Systemd. CentOS 7 uses Systemd instead of the legacy Sys V Init. Under the
   hood, Systemd does things quite a bit differently. Prepare to go through a
   learning curve if you have not done so already.

New installs
============

1. Unless you are already using MariaDB server, you need to ensure that
   the server is configured to start during boot and properly secured
   by running:

	sudo systemctl enable mariadb
	sudo systemctl start mariadb    
	sudo mysql_secure_installation

2. Using the password for the root account set during the previous step, you
   will need to create the ZoneMinder database and configure a database
   account for ZoneMinder to use:

     mysql -u root -p < /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql
     mysql -u root -p
         mysql> grant select,insert,update,delete,lock tables,alter on zm.* to
               'zmuser'@localhost identified by 'zmpass';
         mysql> exit;
     mysqladmin -u root -p reload

   The database account credentials, zmuser/zmpass, are arbitrary. Set them to
   anything that suits your envinroment.

3. If you have chosen to change the zoneminder database account credentials to
   something other than zmuser/zmpass, you must now edit /etc/zm/zm.conf.
   Change ZM_DB_USER and ZM_DB_PASS to the values you created in the previous
   step.

4. Edit /etc/php.ini, uncomment the date.timezone line, and add your local
   timezone.  For whatever reason, PHP will complain loudly if this is not set,
   or if it is set incorrectly, and these complaints will show up in the
   zoneminder logging system as errors.

   If you are not sure of the proper timezone specification to use, look at
   http://php.net/date.timezone

5. This package will automatically configure and install an SELinux policy
   called local_zoneminder. A copy of this policy is in the documentation
   folder.
   
   Maintaining an accurate SELinux policy file that does not create issues has
   been a struggle. If SELinux blocks nortmal ZoneMinder acitivity, or you
   feel you just don't need it, SELinux can be disabled for the current running
   session with the following command:

     sudo setenforce 0

   To permanently disable SELinux, edit /etc/selinux/config and change the
   SELINUX line from "enforcing" to "disabled". This change will take
   effect after a reboot.

6. Now start the web server:

	sudo systemctl enable httpd
	sudo systemctl start httpd

7. Now start zoneminder:

	sudo systemctl enable zoneminder
	sudo systemctl start zoneminder

Upgrades
========

1. Verify /etc/zm/zm.conf.

   If zm.conf was manually edited before running the upgrade, the installation
   may not overwrite it. In this case, it will create the file
   /etc/zm/zm.conf.rpmnew.

   For example, this will happen if you are using database account credentials
   other than zmuser/zmpass.

   Compare /etc/zm/zm.conf to /etc/zm/zm.conf.rpmnew. Verify that zm.conf
   contains any new config settings that may be in zm.conf.rpmnew.

2. Verify permissions of the zmuser account.

   Overtime, the database account permissions required for normal operation
   have changed. Verify the zmuser database account has been granted select,
   insert, update, delete, lock tables, and alter permission to the ZoneMinder
   database:

     mysql -u root -p
         mysql> show grants for zmuser@localhost;
         mysql> exit;

3. Verify the database was upgraded automatically.

   From the web console, ZoneMinder should show a status of "Running", and the
   version number should have incremented.

   If it is not running, then try to start it. The web console will indicate
   if there is a database version conflict. If this is the case, then you may
   need to manually update the database from the command line:
   
     sudo zmupdate.pl

   Modern versions of ZoneMinder don't require any parameters added to the 
   zmupdate command. However, if ZoneMinder complains, you may need to call
   zmupdate in the following manner:

   sudo zmupdate.pl --user=root --pass=<mysql_root_pwd> --version=<from version>
